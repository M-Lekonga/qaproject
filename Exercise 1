Exercise 1

All the principles of java are based on classes and its objects
- Encapsulation: This principle is the practice of keeping field within a
class private, then providing access to them via public methods. It act as
a security feature if a class is private it cannot access by any other class,
public class can access by other class that is within or outside the
package.

- Inheritance: it’s a special feature of object oriented programming in
java. It let programmes create new classes that share some of the
attributes of existing classes. It provides code re-usability.
Example – Animal is a class that contains some general features relating
to animals. Lion is a specific class that contains features that are specific
to an animal Lion.
- Polymorphism: This principle allows programmers to use the same word
to mean different things in different contexts. Method overloading,
method overriding.

- Abstraction: This principle means using simple things to represent
complexity. Simple things like objects, classes, and variables represent
more complex underlying code and data. It’s important because it lets
avoid repeating the same work multiple times.
